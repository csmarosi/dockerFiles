# dockerFiles
This repo contains the definitions of my containers.
I use them to keep my main system clean.

There are elaborate hacks here, so most probably you don't want to clone the whole repo;
you might find some of them useful though.
The scripts in the bin/ directory are in my PATH, while the other are not.

Some containers are less hacky, some even contain their own README files.
